        <h2>Designing a Solution for UPhoto Club</h2>
        <p>In the course Interaction Design Methods, we worked in a team of 3 to design a solution for the Simon Fraser University UPhoto Club. Through observation and interviews, we found that the club had issues with keeping a consistent number of active members, and creating a schedule for events.</p>

        <p>We worked with the club over the span of an entire term learning more about the club and getting their feedback on our ideas. Our group had idea of an art installation as a solution for the club to gain a bigger presence. My role throughout the project consisted mainly of ideating, copywriting, and storyboarding.</p>

        <p>For the final stages of the project, I was in charge of building the installation and creating the final scenario video. The design for our installation was iterated upon to allow for easier access to the touch screens that displayed photos representing a UPhoto online portfolio.</p>
